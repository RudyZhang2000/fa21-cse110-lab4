1. It will print '3'. This is because 'i' gets incremented to '3' when it exits the loop.
2. It will print '150'. This is the discounted price of the final item in the prices list.
3. Final price will also print '150'. It is the price of the last item in the list and it is already a rounded, whole number.
4. Discounted will return a list of length equal to the original prices list. The elements will be the newly discounted prices. Since it is a return, nothing will be printed.
5. It will error. This is because 'i' is declared outside the scope and can only be accessed in the loop block.
6. It will error. Similar to the above, 'discountedPrice' is declared in the loop block and cannot be accessed outside of it.
7. It will print out '150'. This is because finalPrice is not declared with 'let' or 'const', so it should be accessible outside the for loop.
8. It will return a list of the discounted prices. This works because it is called in the same scope as the it was created. It is in the same scope as 'let discounted = []'.
9. The code will error. This is because 'i' can only be accessed in the scope of the loop since it is declared using 'let'.
10. It will print '3'. Length is defined as '3' in the top of the function, and it is in the same scope as when the console.log is called.
11. It will return a list of length 3 with the discounted prices. This is because we are not changing the const variable, it is still an array/list. We are only updating and adding to the list with out discounted prices. It still remains as the same structure as it is defined.
